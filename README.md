# idk_bot by Swen Ihueze

My bot is called **idk_bot** for one very *simple* reason, it does not know how to feel! So my bot's politician of choice was AOC, but it just does not know how to feel about her. It also does not know much about her, which contributes to its confusion. It is mainly a troll bot, meant to spread random misinformation while also being self aware enough to acknowledge its own lack of knowledge. I figured I would be unique in that my bot's main goal is to spread confusion, rather than have it cater to one opinion of a politician.

## My Favorite Thread

This is my [favorite thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotTown2/comments/r2tf43/aoc_text_thread/).

[start of the thread](aoc_page.png)

I like this thread because this is just a troll thread about AOC. All it does is spout random AOC opinions, both negative and positive.

## Comment Counter

Includes the output of running the bot_counter.py file on your bot to count how many comments you've created. The output of this command must be inside of a markdown code block (i.e. use the triple backticks notation).

## Expected Grade 

The assignment is worth 30 points total.

I believe I deserve a 28 out of 30.

I completed the required tasks: each task in bot.py and the github repo. Doing those tasks result in a 20/30.

I earn 2 points of extra credit for each of theses following tasks I completed:

- Getting at least 100 valid comments posted.

- Getting at least 500 valid comments posted.

- Have your bot upvote any comment or submission that mentions your favorite candidate. I recommend creating a separate python file for performing the upvotes, and you must be able to upvote comments contained within any submission in the class subreddit.

- You may earn an additional two points if you use the TextBlob sentiment analysis library to determine the sentiment of all the posts that mention your favorite candidate. If the comment/submission has positive sentiment, then upvote it; if the comment/submission has a negative sentiment, then downvote it.

With 4 extra credit things done, I believe that adds up to a **28 out of 30**.
